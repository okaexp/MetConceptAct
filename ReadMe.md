# Metaphor Concept Activation

### Abstract

This is a repository which shares the data and code regarding the paper entitled "Features interaction in metaphor aptness: The impact of shared features and their distance" (under review)

### Directories
- `sorting_and_aptness`: The demo programs to conduct the metaphor aptness rating task (`3_aptness_v0.2.html`) and the feature arrangement task (`3_sorting_v0.3.html`) are summarized in `OnlineExp` directory. Also, the data (raw_data) and program to replicate the results reported in section 3.1 and 3.2 (src) are summarized in `Analysis` directory.

- `model_analysis`: The data (the item-averaged bariables obtained in the metaphor aptness rating task and feature arrangement task), notebook (calculate the semantic distances based on the pretrained BERT model), src (replicate the results reported in section 3.3), and results (calculated euclidian distances based on the prertained BERT model) are summarized this directory.
